# Notes on Malware Analysis
## This is a sub repo of my [Obsidian Notes](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes) vault.

I've expanded it into its own repo so it can be an accessible resource to others. This houses all of my notes I've generated while working through the [Practical Malware Analysis & Triage course](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-malware-analysis-triage) (PMAT) from [TCM Security](https://tcm-sec.com/).

### THIS REPO DOES NOT CONTAIN MATERIAL PRODUCED OR DISTRIBUTED BY TCM SECURITY

Instead, these are my own notes which I created and use for my own learning and studying. If other outside references are used they will be linked appropriately.

### Some notes on use:
This is a sub directory of my personal notes in [Obsidian Desktop](https://obsidian.md/) so some of the links will not work because they are relative to the entire vault rather than just the PMAT directory. Sorry.

If there is a link you can't follow, that means the linked notes exist in my [obsidian-notes repo](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes) and you can find them there! I will try to link them (to their remote/external GitHub paths) throughout.

## Thank you so much for stopping by and I hope this repo is useful for someone out there in the void!

P.S. Reference these notes at your own risk, I cannot verify their accuracy :)
